## Introduction

This document presents the derivation of an equation to calculate aboveground biomass (AGB) directly from diameter at breast height (DBH). The derivation uses two equations:
1. AGB as a function of height (\(H\)) and canopy area (\(CA\)).
2. DBH as a function of \(H\) and \(CA\).

By substituting the expression for \(H \cdot CA\) from Equation 2 into Equation 1, we derive a direct relationship between AGB and DBH. These equations are taken from Jucker et al. 2017.

## Equations

### Equation 1: AGB as a function of \(H\) and \(CA\)

\[
\text{AGB} = \left(0.016 + a'\right) \cdot (H \cdot CA)^{2.013 + b'} \cdot \exp\left(\frac{0.204^2}{2}\right)
\]

Where:
- \(a'\) and \(b'\) are species-specific parameters.
- \(H\) is canopy height.
- \(CA\) is canopy area.

For simplicity, let:
\[
m = (0.016 + a') \cdot \exp\left(\frac{0.204^2}{2}\right)
\]
This simplifies Equation 1 to:
\[
\text{AGB} = m \cdot (H \cdot CA)^{2.013 + b'}
\]

### Equation 2: DBH as a function of \(H\) and \(CA\)

\[
\text{DBH} = a \cdot (H \cdot CA)^b \cdot \exp\left(\frac{g^2}{2}\right)
\]

Where:
- \(a, b, g\) are biome-specific parameters.
- \(H\) is canopy height.
- \(CA\) is canopy area.

For simplicity, let:
\[
k = a \cdot \exp\left(\frac{g^2}{2}\right)
\]
This simplifies Equation 2 to:
\[
\text{DBH} = k \cdot (H \cdot CA)^b
\]

## Derivation

### Step 1: Express \(H \cdot CA\) in terms of DBH

From Equation 2:
\[
H \cdot CA = \left(\frac{\text{DBH}}{k}\right)^{1/b}
\]

---

### Step 2: Substitute \(H \cdot CA\) into Equation 1

Substitute \(H \cdot CA\) from above into the simplified Equation 1:
\[
\text{AGB} = m \cdot \left[\left(\frac{\text{DBH}}{k}\right)^{1/b}\right]^{2.013 + b'}
\]

---

### Step 3: Simplify the Expression

Distribute the exponent \(2.013 + b'\) across \(\left(\frac{\text{DBH}}{k}\right)^{1/b}\):
\[
\text{AGB} = m \cdot \left(\frac{\text{DBH}}{k}\right)^{\frac{2.013 + b'}{b}}
\]

Separate the terms into DBH and \(k\):
\[
\text{AGB} = m \cdot \text{DBH}^{\frac{2.013 + b'}{b}} \cdot k^{-\frac{2.013 + b'}{b}}
\]

Let:
\[
n = m \cdot k^{-\frac{2.013 + b'}{b}}
\]
This simplifies the equation to:
\[
\text{AGB} = n \cdot \text{DBH}^p
\]

Where:
- \(n = m \cdot k^{-\frac{2.013 + b'}{b}}\), a constant that combines species and biome-specific parameters.
- \(p = \frac{2.013 + b'}{b}\), the power exponent.

---

## Final Equation

The final equation to calculate AGB directly from DBH is:
\[
\text{AGB} = n \cdot \text{DBH}^p
\]

## Discussion

### Why this Works
The derivation leverages the relationships between DBH, canopy height (\(H\)), and canopy area (\(CA\)). By substituting \(H \cdot CA\) from the DBH equation into the AGB equation, we obtain a direct relationship between AGB and DBH. The constants \(n\) and \(p\) are determined by species and biome-specific parameters, ensuring that the equation accurately represents the underlying biology of tree growth.

### Required Data
To apply this equation, the following data are required:
1. Species-specific parameters (\(a', b'\)) for the AGB equation.
2. Biome-specific parameters (\(a, b, g\)) for the DBH equation.
3. Measurements of DBH for trees in the area of interest.

### Practical Use
This equation allows for efficient estimation of AGB when DBH measurements are available. It is particularly useful in large-scale ecological studies, where direct measurement of \(H\) and \(CA\) may not be feasible, but DBH data are readily obtainable.
